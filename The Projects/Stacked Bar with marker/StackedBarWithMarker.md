# Stacked bar chart with marker
Pie charts have some kind of bad reputation in the data visualization community, from my point of view, this is for a reason.
Nevertheless, there is a very specific data visualization task where pie charts and donuts chart excel. This task is simply this, make the items easily discoverable that contribute 50% or any given number of the whole.
In this blog article I'm describing this taks in more detail: https://www.minceddata.info/2021/04/03/the-pineapple-pizza-debate-or-why-pie-chart-are-not-that-evil/
What I'm trying to achieve with this data visualization is simple, keep the capabilities of a bar chart, like the comparison of the relative size between the bars, ordered bars, but also provide a visual hint that helps to easily identify the segements inside a stack that contribute 50% of the whole.

In the next couple of weeks I will add the capability of adding data labels for the segments and for the total. Basically, this is quite simple, unfortunately, it's not that simple to avoid overlap - challenge accepted.
